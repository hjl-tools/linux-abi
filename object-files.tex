\subsection{EH\_FRAME section}
\label{sec_eh_frame}

The call frame information needed for unwinding the stack is output into
one section named
\code{.eh_frame}.  An \code{.eh_frame} section consists of one or more
subsections. Each subsection contains a CIE (Common Information Entry)
followed by varying number of FDEs (Frame Descriptor Entry). A FDE
corresponds to an explicit or compiler generated function in a
compilation unit, all FDEs can access the CIE that begins their
subsection for data.  If the code for a function is not one contiguous
block, there will be a separate FDE for each contiguous sub-piece.

If an object file contains C++ template instantiations there shall be
a separate CIE immediately preceding each FDE corresponding to an
instantiation.

Using the preferred encoding specified below, the \code{.eh_frame} section can
be entirely resolved at link time and thus can become part of the
text segment.

\code{EH_PE} encoding below refers to the pointer encoding as specified in
Section \texttt{DWARF Exception Header Encoding} of Linux Standard Base
Core Specification.

The existence and size of the optional call frame instruction area must
be computed
based on the overall size and the offset reached while scanning the
preceding fields of the CIE or FDE.

The overall size of a \code{.eh_frame} section is given in the ELF section
header.  The only way to determine the number of entries is to scan
the section until the end, counting entries as they are encountered.

\end{description}

\subsubsection{The program property array}

Each array element represents one program property with type, data size
and data.  In 64-bit objects, each element is an array of 8-byte integers
in the format of the target processor.  In 32-bit objects, each element
is an array of 4-byte integers in the format of the target processor.
An array element has the following structure:

\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct {
  Elf_Word pr_type;
  Elf_Word pr_datasz;
  unsigned char pr_data[PR_DATASZ];
  unsigned char pr_padding[PR_PADDING];
} Elf_Prop;
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
 \item[pr_type] The type of program property.  A 4-byte integer in the
   format of the target processor.
 \item[pr_datasz] The size of the \code{pr_data} field.  A 4-byte
   integer in the format of the target processor.
 \item[pr_data] The program property descriptor.  An array of 4-byte
   integers in 32-bit object or 8-byte integers in 64-bit objects, in
   the format of the target processor.
 \item[pr_padding] The padding.  If necessary, it aligns the array
   element to 8 or 4-byte alignment (depending on whether the file is
   a 64-bit or 32-bit object).
 \item[PR_DATASZ] The value in the \code{pr_datasz} field.  A constant.
 \item[PR_PADDING] The size of the \code{pr_padding} field.  A constant.
\end{description}

The array elements are sorted by the program property type.

\subsubsection{Types of program properties}

The following program property types are defined:

    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\Hrule
\end{table}

\begin{description}
 \item[GNU_PROPERTY_STACK_SIZE]
   Its \code{pr_data} field contains an integer in the format of the
   target processor.  Linker should select the maximum value among all
   input relocatable objects and copy this property to the output.
   Run-time loader should raise the stack limit to the value specified
   in this property.
 \item[GNU_PROPERTY_NO_COPY_ON_PROTECTED]
   \begin{sloppypar}
   This indicates that there should be no copy relocations against
   protected data symbols.  If a relocatable object contains this
   property, linker should treat protected data symbol as defined
   locally at run-time and copy this property to the output share
   object.  Linker should add this property to the output share
   object if any protected symbol is expected to be defined locally
   at run-time.  Run-time loader should disallow copy relocations
   against protected data symbols defined in share objects with
   \code{GNU_PROPERTY_NO_COPY_ON_PROTECTED} property.  Its
   \code{PR_DATASZ} should be 0.
   \end{sloppypar}
 \item[GNU_PROPERTY_LOPROC through GNU_PROPERTY_HIPROC]
   Values in this inclusive range are reserved for processor-specific
   semantics.
 \item[GNU_PROPERTY_LOUSER through GNU_PROPERTY_HIUSER]
   Values in this inclusive range are reserved for application-specific
   semantics.

   third, and fourth 4-byte integers contain the earliest compatible
   kernel version.  For example, if the 3 integers are 2, 2, and 5, this
   signifies a 2.2.5 kernel.

\subsection{Alignment of Note Sections}

All entries in a \texttt{PT_NOTE} segment have the same alignment which
equals to the {\tt p_align} field in program header.

According to gABI, each note entry should be aligned to 4 bytes in
32-bit objects or 8 bytes in 64-bit objects.  But \code{.note.ABI-tag}
section (see Section~\ref{sec_abi_tag}) and \code{.note.gnu.build-id}
section (see Section~\ref{sec_build_id}) are aligned to 4 bytes in
both 32-bit and 64-bit objects.  Note parser should use {\tt p_align}
for note alignment, instead of assuming alignment based on ELF file class.

\subsection{\texttt{STT_GNU_IFUNC} Symbol}

This symbol type is the same as \texttt{STT_FUNC} except that it always
points to a resolve function or piece of executable code which takes
no arguments and returns a function pointer.  If an \texttt{STT_GNU_IFUNC}
symbol is referred to by a relocation, then evaluation of that relocation
is delayed until load-time.  The value used in the relocation is the
function pointer returned by an invocation of the \texttt{STT_GNU_IFUNC}
symbol.

The purpose of the \texttt{STT_GNU_IFUNC} symbol type is to allow the
run-time to select between multiple versions of the implementation of
a specific function.  The selection made in general will take the
currently available hardware into account and select the most
appropriate version.

\subsubsection{Implementation Considerations}

The calling convention of the \texttt{STT_GNU_IFUNC} resolve
function, which takes no arguments and returns a function pointer,
should follow the processor-specific ABI. All rules for caller-saved
and callee-saved registers apply.

There are special considerations for GOT when PLT is required:

\begin{itemize}
\item All references to a \texttt{STT_GNU_IFUNC} symbol, including
function call and function pointer, should go through the PLT slot,
which jumps to the address stored in the GOT entry.  If the
\texttt{STT_GNU_IFUNC} symbol is locally defined, a processor-specific
\texttt{IRELATIVE} relocation should be applied to the GOT entry at load
time.  Otherwise, dynamic linker will lookup the symbol at the first
reference to the function and update the GOT entry.  This applies to all
usages of \texttt{STT_GNU_IFUNC} symbols in shared library, dynamic
executable and static executable.

Instead of branching to an \texttt{STT_GNU_IFUNC} symbol directly, calling
a function always branches to its PLT entry, which simply loads its GOTPLT
entry and branches to it.  Its GOTPLT entry has the real function address.

\item An \texttt{STT_GNU_IFUNC} symbol has an optional GOT entry for the
function pointer value of the symbol.  To load an \texttt{STT_GNU_IFUNC}
symbol function pointer value:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Use its GOTPLT entry in a shared object if it is forced local or
        not dynamic.
  \item Use its GOTPLT entry in a non-shared object if pointer equality
        isn't needed.
  \item Use its GOTPLT entry in a position independent executable (PIE).
  \item Use its GOTPLT entry if no normal GOT, other than GOTPLT, is used.
  \item Otherwise use its GOT entry.  We only need to relocate its GOT
        entry in a shared object.
  \end{itemize}

\item We need dynamic relocation for \texttt{STT_GNU_IFUNC} symbol only
when there is a non-GOT reference in a shared object.

\item When a shared library references a \texttt{STT_GNU_IFUNC} symbol
defined in executable, the address of the resolved function may be used.
But in non-shared executable, the address of its GOTPLT entry may be used.
Pointer equality may not work correctly.  PIE should be used if pointer
equality is required.
